1. Reference gpa-script.py to understand where DataFrame is coming in. Will use reticulate to read in a pickled file

```{r}
#Packages

library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(mosaic)
library(reticulate)

#read in data
setwd("Documents/GitHub/Stat380/GPA_Predictor/")
results <- read.csv("result.csv", header = FALSE)
colnames(results) <- as.character(unlist(results[1,]))
results= results[-1, ]


```
