1. Reference gpa-script.py to understand where DataFrame is coming in. Will use reticulate to read in a pickled file

```{r}
#Packages

library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(mosaic)
library(reticulate)
library(data.table)

#read in data
setwd("Documents/GitHub/Stat380/GPA_Predictor/")
results <- read.csv("results.csv", header = TRUE)

#Rename Columns 
setnames(results, old=c("X0","X1","X2","X3","X4","X5","X6"), new=c("Term","Subject", "Catalog Nbr","Course Title","Grade"," Units","Type"))

results <- results[-1,]
```


```{r}
#Going to take only B- or higher... If B- or higher we assign it a 1 else its a 0
#Stem Classes Receive a 1 and Non Stem receive a 0
result <- results %>%
  mutate(Grade = ifelse( Grade == "B-" | Grade == "B" | Grade == "B+" | Grade == "A-" | Grade == "A", 1,0)) %>%
  mutate(Subject = ifelse(Subject == "CHEM" | Subject == "MATH"|Subject == "STAT" | Subject == "MICRB" | Subject == "BIOL" | Subject == "ASTRO", 1,0))

#Find Proportion of stem classes 
n = nrow(result)
pert_stem <- round(sum(result$Subject == 1) / n ,4) *100 
cat("Percent of STEM Classes taken:",pert_stem,"%\n")

#Find Pass Fail Ratio (Really its B- And Above)
r = nrow(result)
pert_pass <- round(sum(result$Grade == 1) / n ,4) *100 
cat("You have passed:",pert_pass,"% of you classes\n")




```
